# WTAReviewScraper
A scrapy webcrawler orginally implemented to scrape hike information and trip report data from WTA's hike website and upload to private mongodb collection for internal use, mainly data processing and data analysis practice.

I rely heavily on the scrapy documentation at docs.scrapy.org.
